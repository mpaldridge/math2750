# Assessment 1 {.unnumbered #A1}


::: {.mysummary}
This assessment counts as 4% of your final module grade. You should attempt both questions. You must show your working, and there are marks for the quality of your mathematical writing.

The deadline for submission is **Thursday 11 February at 2pm**. Submission will be to Gradescope via Minerva, from Monday 8 February. It would be helpful to start your solution to Question 2 on a new page. If you hand-write your solutions and scan them using your phone, please convert to PDF using a scanning app (I like Microsoft Office Lens or Adobe Scan) rather than submit images.

Late submissions up to Wednesday 17 February at 2pm will still be marked, but	the total mark will be reduced by 10% per day or part-day for which the work is late. Submissions are not permitted after Wednesday 17 February.

**1.** Let $(X_n)$ be a simple random walk that starts from $X_0 = 0$ and on each step goes up one with probability $p$ and down one with probability $q = 1-p$.

Calculate:

::: {.subq}
**(a)** $\mathbb P(X_6 = 0)$, [[1 mark]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(b)** $\mathbb EX_6$, [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(c)** $\text{Var}(X_6)$, [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(d)** $\mathbb E(X_{10} \mid X_4 = 4)$, [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(e)** $\mathbb P(X_{10} = 0 \mid X_6 = 2)$, [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(f)**  $\mathbb P(X_4 = 2 \mid X_{10} = 6)$. [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::

Consider the case $p = 0.6$, so $q = 0.4$.

::: {.subq}
**(g)** What are $\mathbb E X_{100}$ and $\text{Var}(X_{100})$? [[1]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(h)** Using a normal approximation, estimate $\mathbb P(16 \leq X_{100} \leq 26)$. You should use an appropriate "continuity correction", and explain why you chose it. (Bear in mind the possible values $X_{100}$ can take.) [[3]]{style="float:right"}

**2.** Consider the gambler's ruin with draws: Alice starts with £$a$ and Bob with £$(m-a)$, and at each time step Alice wins £1 off Bob with probability $p$, loses £1 to Bob with probability $q$, and no money is exchanged with probability $s$, where $p+q+s =1$. We consider the case where Bob and Alice are equally matched, so $p = q$ and $s = 1-2p$. (We assume $0 < p < 1/2$.)

Let $r_i$ be Alice's ruin probability from the point she has £$i$.

::: {.subq}
**(a)** By conditioning on the first step, explain why $pr_{i+1} - (1-s)r_i + pr_{i-1} = 0$, and give appropriate boundary conditions. [[2]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(b)** Solve this linear difference equation to find an expression for $r_i$.  [[2]]{style="float:right"}
:::

Let $d_i$ be the expected duration of the game from the point Alice has £$i$.

::: {.subq}
**(c)** Explain why $pd_{i+1} - (1-s)d_i + pd_{i-1} = -1$, and give appropriate boundary conditions. [[2]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(d)** Solve this linear difference equation to find an expression for $d_i$.  [[2]]{style="float:right"}
:::
::: {.subq}
**(e)** Compare your answer to parts (b) and (d) with those for the standard gambler's ruin problem with $p = 1/2$, and give reasons for the similarities or differences.  [[2]]{style="float:right"}
