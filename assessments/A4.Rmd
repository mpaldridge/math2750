# Assessment 4 {.unnumbered #A4}


::: {.mysummary}
This assessment counts as 4% of your final module grade. You should attempt both questions. You must show your working, and there are marks for the quality of your mathematical writing.

The deadline for submission is **Thursday 6 May at 2pm**. Submission will be to Gradescope via Minerva, from Tuesday 4 May. It would be helpful to start your solution to Question 2 on a new page. If you hand-write your solutions and scan them using your phone, please convert to PDF using a scanning app (I like Microsoft Office Lens or Adobe Scan) rather than submit images.

Late submissions up to Thursday 13 May at 2pm will still be marked, but	the total mark will be reduced by 10% per day or part-day for which the work is late. Submissions are not permitted after Thursday 13 May.

Your solutions to this assessment should be your own work. Copying, collaboration or plagiarism are not permitted. Asking others to do your work, including via the internet, is not permitted. Transgressions are considered to be a very serious matter, and will be dealt with according to the University's disciplinary procedures.
