**Question 0:** *Answer as many of the questions on this problem sheet as you can. Write up a short report on your findings, with answers to the questions you have studied. Make sure to include relevant graphs produced and the R code you used.*


Remember that this worksheet is just for practice, and not assessed for credit. However, Computational Worksheet 2 *is* assessed work. I am happy for that report to be submitted in any format, including: HTML or PDF produced by [R Markdown](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/), PDF produced by LaTeX, Microsoft Word document, or handwritten report with R printouts for plots.



**Question 1.** *We will be studying the simple random walk starting from $X_0 = 0$ with up probability $p = 0.6$ and down probability $q = 1 - p = 0.4$. Produce a sample of the first $N = 10$ steps of this simple random walk.*


We want to start by building the increments process $(Z_n)$, where each $Z_n$ is $+1$ with probability $p = 0.6$ and $-1$ with probability $q = 0.4$. We will use the `sample` function to do this. You can find out how to use `sample` by reading the help file, which you can open by entering `?sample` in the console. What arguments do you need to give to `sample` to get $10$ values of $\pm 1$ with the correct probabilities? What, for example, do we get from the following?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Z <- sample(c(1, 7, 4), 20, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2))
Z
```

What is the purpose of the argument `replace = TRUE`? Can you adapt the above code to get the desired increments process?

Once we have the increments process $(Z_n)$, we need to transform it into a random walk $(X_n)$. A useful function here is the *cumulative sum* function `cumsum`. The cumulative sum of a vector $(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n)$ is the vector of partial sums
$$ (y_1, y_1 + y_2, y_1 + y_2 + y_3, \dots, y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_n) . $$
How can we use this function to form a random walk from the increments?

All together, your code to produce the random walk should look something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- 0.6
q <- 1 - p
N <- 10
Z <- # Add your code for increments
Z    # Should produce a string of 10 plus-or-minus 1s
X <- # Turn increments into a random walk
X    # Should produce something that looks like a random walk
```



**Question 2.** *Plot a sample of the random walk for $N = 10$ steps and for $N = 10000$ steps. Try to make your plots look smart, for example by giving them titles and labelling the axes. Briefly comment on the differences between the plots.*


The standard command to plot a vector $\mathbf{X}$ of length $N$ against $1, 2, \dots, N$ is `plot(1:N, X)`; or just `plot(X)` for short. Here `1:N` means the vector $(1, 2, \dots, N)$.

You will probably want to include the starting point $X_0 = 0$ on your plot too. How can you do this?

The plot function can take extra optional arguments. You can find out about these by typing `?plot`, which brings up the help for the function `plot`. For example, what does the following do?

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
plot(1:N, X,
     type = "b",
     col  = "red",
     ylim = c(-15, 15),
     xlab = "Test",
     main = "Hello!")
```

Use `?plot` (or Google, or ask a friend) to find out the possible arguments to `type = `, and make sure to pick the most appropriate one. You may find that different arguments are appropriate for the $N = 10$ and $N = 10000$ cases.

Remember to comment on the differences between the plots.



**Question 3.** *Make a function in R that produces a sample of a simple random walk for given $p$ of length $N$. Test your function to check it works. What are the advantages of making a a function like this?*


You'll want a syntax something like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
RandomWalk <- function(N, p) {
  Z <- # Your code for N increments that are +1 with probability p
       # and -1 otherwise
  cumsum(Z)
}
```

If you do this correctly, then, for example,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
X <- RandomWalk(20, 0.3)
X
```

should produce a simple random walk of length $20$ with $p = 0.3$. It might be helpful to check by plotting a random walk of your choice.



**Question 4.** *Estimate the expected value of of the simple random walk at $N = 100$ steps by simulating many random walks and taking an average. How does this compare with the true answer?*


Given a vector `x`, we know that, for example, `x[10]` gives the 10th element of the vector. So, using your `RandomWalk` function, `RandomWalk(N, p)[N]` should give the final value of an random walk of length $N$.
  
We can use the `replicate` function (read `?replicate` to learn more) to get a large number of samples of the random walk.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
N <- 100
trials <- 10000  # Or some other appropriate large number
samples <- replicate(trials, RandomWalk(N, p)[N])
# Now add code to output the average of samples
```

What does theory we have learned say the answer should be?



**Question 5.** (Optional) *Investigate estimating other properties of the simple random walk through simulation.*
