## MATH2750 Lecture notes

*This repository contain files for notes for the course MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes at the University of Leeds.*

The notes are written using the Bookdown extension to RMarkdown. The website produced by these files is at <https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/>, where I'm gradually unveiling the material at a rate of two sections of notes and one problem sheet per week. By clicking the PDF button on the top ribbon of that site, you can also see the notes in (aesthetically suboptimal) PDF form.

This is work in progress; the early parts are finished (as of 11 March 2021, up to Section 14), while the later parts are in various states of unfinishedness (from "not even started" to "ready to appear as soon as they are uncommented").

* **`sections`** contains one RMarkdown file for each of the 22 sections of notes (in the Before Times, these were one lecture each)
* **`problems`** contains one RMarkdown file for each of the 10 problem sheets. I've done some monkeying around so that the the answers are hidden until I change just a couple of lines of code, then the answers all appear. (Note that a highly enterprising student could work out how to find the solutions, so I don't use this for assessed work.)
* **`assessments`** contains the assessed problem sheets.
* **`computing`** contains the computational worksheets.
* **`docs`** contains the actual output; that is the code for the website itself, as produced by Bookdown.

Videos were separately [uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3yxTRIYqPLWCz8k1cFYmreJvClole1V) and embedded in the notes.

I've also written [A brief introduction to RMarkdown and Bookdown](https://mpaldridge.github.io/rmarkdown-bookdown/).
