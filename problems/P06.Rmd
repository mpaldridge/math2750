**1.** Consider a Markov chain $(X_n)$ with state space $\mathcal S =\{1,2,3\}$ and transition matrix
\[ \mathsf P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.   \]

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Draw a transition diagram for this Markov chain. Is it irreducible? Is each state periodic or aperiodic?

The Markov chain is irreducible, since we have $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1$. Since we continually cycle around the triangle, it's clear that the period is $d = 3$.	
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is $m_i$, the return probability, for each state? What is $\mu_i$, the expected return time for each state.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
	Again, since we continually cycle around the triangle, we always return in $3$ steps, so $m_i = 1$ and $\mu_i =3$ for all $i$.
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** By solving $\boldsymbol \pi = \boldsymbol\pi \mathsf P$, find the stationary distribution. Use this to confirm the values of $\mu_i$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
The equations give $\pi_1 = \pi_3$, $\pi_2 = \pi_1$ and $\pi_3 = \pi_2$, meaning they're all equal. The normalising condition gives $\boldsymbol\pi = (\frac13, \frac13, \frac13)$. The expected return times are $\mu_i = 1/\pi_i = 3$, as predicted.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
For what initial distributions $\boldsymbol\lambda$ do the limits $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb P(X_n = i)$ exist?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
For a given initial condition $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$ it's clear we cycle through the initial condition, $(\lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_1)$, and $(\lambda_3, \lambda_1, \lambda_2)$. Hence the limits only exist if $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2  = \lambda_3 = \frac13$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** What is the long-run proportion of time spent in each state?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Since the Markov chain is irreducible and positive recurrent (like every finite irreducible chain), the ergodic theorem tells us that the long-run proportion of time spent in each state $i$ is $\pi_i = \frac13$.

**2.** Every person has two chromosomes; each chromosome is a copy of a chromosome from one of the person's parents.  There are two types of chromosome, which are conventionally labelled X and Y. A child born with a Y chromosome is male, while a child with two X chromosomes is female.

Haemophilia is a blood-clotting disorder caused by a defective X chromosome (we will label this as $\text X^*$).  Females with the defective chromosome ($\text X^*\text X$) will not typically show symptoms of the disease but can pass it on to children -- they are `carriers'.  Males with the defective chromosome ($\text X^* \text Y$) have the disease and its symptoms.

A medical statistician is studying the progress of the disease through first-born children, starting with a female carrier.  The statistician makes the following assumptions: First, each parent has an equal probability of passing either of their chromosomes to their children. Second, the partner of each person in the study does not have a defective X chromosome. Third, no new genetic disorders occur.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that we can use a Markov chain to model the progress of the disease under the above assumptions.  What is the state space? Draw a transition diagram.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Consider a stochastic process on the state space $\mathcal S = \{\text{F}, \text{M}, \text{m}, \text{f}\}$, where F means the first-born child is a female carrier, M means the child is a male haemophiliac, f means the child is a female non-carrier, and m means the child is a male without the disease. (This is not the only way to set up the Markov chain.) If we let $(X_n)$ be the status of the first-born child at the $n$th generation, then it is clear that $X_{n+1}$, the status of the $(n+1)$st individual, will depend on the status of their parent $X_n$, but, given that, will not depend further on the history of the process. So we have the Markov property.

The transition probabilities are: From a female carrier, $p_{\mathrm{FF}} = \frac14$ or $p_{\mathrm{FM}} = \frac14$ if she passes on the $\text X^*$, or $p_{\mathrm{Ff}} = p_{\mathrm{Fm}} = \frac14$ if not. From a male haemophiliac, $p_{\mathrm{MF}} = \frac12$ if he passes on the $\text X^*$, or $p_{\mathrm{Mm}} = \frac12$ if not. From those without the $\text X^*$, we have $p_{\mathrm{ff}} = p_{\mathrm{fm}} = p_{\mathrm{mf}} =p_{\mathrm{mm}} = \frac12$.

**(b)** What are the communicating classes in the chain? Is each class positive recurrent, null recurrent, or transient?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Note we can move from F or M to f or m but not back again. So the class $\{\text F, \text M\}$ is non-closed and thus transient, while the class $\{\text f, \text m\}$ is closed and thus positive recurrent.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** Calculate a stationary distribution. Is this the only stationary distribution?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
We have a stationary distribution is $\pi_{\mathrm M} = \pi_{\mathrm{F}} = 0$, $\pi_{\mathrm m} = \pi_{\mathrm f} = \frac12$. One way to see this is to solve $\boldsymbol\pi = \boldsymbol\pi\mathsf P$. Another way is the following: Since F and M are transient we must have $\pi_{\mathrm M} = \pi_{\mathrm{F}} = 0$. But, within the recurrent class, m and f are symmetrical, so we must have $\pi_{\mathrm m} = \pi_{\mathrm f}$. The result follows.

Since there is exactly one positive recurrent class, the stationary distribution is unique.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** Under this model, what is the limiting probability that, in many generations' time, a child has haemophilia?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Since M and F are transient states, we have $\lim \mathbb P(X_n = \mathrm F) = \lim \mathbb P(X_n = \mathrm M) = 0$, so the limiting probability is $0$.

**3.**
An airline operates a frequent flyer scheme with four classes of membership; Ordinary, Bronze, Silver and Gold.  Scheme members get benefits according to their membership class.
Changing membership class operates as follows:

* If a member books two or more flights in a given year, they are moved up a class of membership for the next year (or remain at Gold).
* If a member books a single flight, they remain in their current class in the following year.
* If a member books no flights, they move down a class (or remain at Ordinary).

The airline's research has shown that in a given year 40% of members book no flights, 40% book exactly one flight and the remaining 20% book two or more flights, independent of their history. Moreover, the cost of running the scheme per member is estimated as £0 for Ordinary members, £10 for Bronze members, £20 for Silver members, and £30 for Gold members.

:::: {.subq}
Show that this system can be modelled using a Markov chain. Write down the transition probabilities and draw a transition diagram.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
	We write $\mathcal S = \{\text{O},\text{B},\text{S},\text{G}\}$ for the set of states, and let $X_n$ be the membership level in year $n$. Next year's membership level depends on this year's, but not, given this year's, on the previous history, so we have the Markov property.
	
With probability $40\%$, a member books no flights, giving
	\[ p_{\mathrm{BO}} = p_{\mathrm{SB}} = p_{\mathrm{GG}} = 0.4 . \]
	With probability $40\%$, a member books one flights, giving
	\[ p_{\mathrm{BB}} = p_{\mathrm{SS}} = 0.4  \]
	and $p_{\mathrm{OO}} = 0.4+0.4 = 0.8$.
	With probability $20\%$, a member books two or more flights, giving
	\[ p_{\mathrm{OB}} = p_{\mathrm{BS}} = p_{\mathrm{SG}} = 0.2  \]
	and $p_{\mathrm{GG}} = 0.4+0.2 = 0.6$.

**(b)** Explain why a unique stationary distribution exists and calculate it.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
The Markov chain is irreducible and positive recurrent, so has a unique stationary distribution.
	
The equations from $\boldsymbol\pi = \boldsymbol\pi \mathsf P$ are
	\begin{align}
	\pi_{\mathrm O} &= 0.8 \pi_{\mathrm O} + 0.4 \pi_{\mathrm B } & 2\pi_{\mathrm B} &= \pi_{\mathrm O} \\
	\pi_{\mathrm B} &= 0.2\pi_{\mathrm O} + 0.4\pi_{\mathrm B} + 0.4\pi_{\mathrm S} & 3\pi_{\mathrm B} - 2\pi_{\mathrm S} &= \pi_{\mathrm O} \\
	\pi_{\mathrm S} &= \phantom{0.2 \pi_{\mathrm S} +{}} 0.2 \pi_{\mathrm B} + 0.4 \pi_{\mathrm S} + 0.4 \pi_{\mathrm G} & \text{(discard)} \hspace{-0.5cm} & \notag \\
	\pi_{\mathrm G} &= \phantom{0.2 \pi_{\mathrm S} + 0.2 \pi_{\mathrm B} +{}} 0.2 \pi_{\mathrm S} + 0.6 \pi_{\mathrm G} &  \pi_{\mathrm S} - 2 \pi_{\mathrm G} &= 0
	\end{align}
where we have rewritten them in terms of the working variable $\pi_{\mathrm O}$. From (1) we get $\pi_{\mathrm B} = \frac12\pi_{\mathrm O}$. Substituting this into (2), we get $\pi_{\mathrm S} = \frac14\pi_{\mathrm O}$. Substituting this into (3), we get $\pi_{\mathrm G} = \frac18\pi_{\mathrm O}$. The normalising condition is
	\[ \pi_{\mathrm O} + \pi_{\mathrm B} + \pi_{\mathrm S} + \pi_{\mathrm G} = \left(1 + \tfrac12 + \tfrac14 + \tfrac18\right)\pi_{\mathrm O} = \tfrac{15}{8} \pi_{\mathrm O} = 1 . \]
Hence $\pi_{\mathrm O} = \frac{8}{15}$. Back-solving, we get the solution
	\[ \left(\pi_{\mathrm O},\pi_{\mathrm B},\pi_{\mathrm S},\pi_{\mathrm G}\right) = \left(\tfrac8{15},\tfrac{4}{15},\tfrac{2}{15},\tfrac{1}{15} \right) . \]

**(c)** The airline makes a profit of £10 per passenger per flight, before the cost of the frequent flyer scheme. In the long run, does the airline expect to remain in profit after the cost of the scheme?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
By the ergodic theorem, the long run time spent in state $x$ is $\pi_x$. So the long-run cost per member is
    \[ 0\pi_{\mathrm O} + 10\pi_{\mathrm B} + 20 \pi_{\mathrm S} + 30\pi_{\mathrm G}
    = 0 \cdot\tfrac8{15} + 10\cdot\tfrac{4}{15} + 20\cdot\tfrac{2}{15} + 30 \cdot \tfrac{1}{15} = \tfrac{110}{15} = \tfrac{22}{3} , \]
for a cost of \pounds 7.33.
The average number of flights taken per member is at least
    \[ 0.4\times 0 + 0.4 \times 1 + 0.2\times 2 = 0.8 , \]
for a profit of at least $10\times0.8 = \text{\pounds}8$. ("At least" because the probability $0.2$ refers to "two or more" flights.) Since $8 >7.33$, the airline will make a profit in the long run.

**4.** We have $N$ balls, each of which is placed into one of two urns. At each time step, a ball is chosen uniformly at random and moved to the other urn.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that the stationary probability the first urn contains $i$ balls is
\[ \frac{1}{2^N} \binom{N}{i} . \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* One way to solve this is to let $X_n$ be the number of balls in the first urn after having moved $n$ balls. This has transition probabilities
\[ p_{i,i+1} = 1 - \frac{i}{N} \qquad p_{i,i-1} = \frac{i}{N} . \]
The equations for the stationary distribution are
\[ \pi_i = \left(1 - \frac{i-1}{N}\right)\pi_{i-1} + \frac{i+1}N \pi_{i+1} . \]
One can check that $\pi_i = C \binom{N}{i}$ satisfies this for any constant $C$ by using the combinatorial identities
\begin{align*}
\left(1 - \frac{i-1}{N}\right)\binom{N}{i-1} &= \binom{N-1}{i-1} \\
\frac{i+1}N \binom{N}{i+1} &= \binom{N-1}{i} \\
\binom{N-1}{i-1} + \binom{N-1}{i} &= \binom Ni ,
\end{align*}
and check that the normalising condition demands $C = 1/2^N$ because of
\[ \sum_{i=0}^N \binom Ni = 2^N . \]

The following is perhaps a better way. Let $Y_n^j = 1$ denote that ball $j$ is in the first urn at time $n$, and $Y_n^j = 2$ denote that it is in the second urn. Let $\mathbf Y_n = (Y_n^1, Y_n^2, \dots, Y_n^N)$. Then $(\mathbf Y_n)$ is a Markov chain on the state space $\mathcal S = \{1,2\}^N$. The transition probabilities are that $p_{\mathbf{yz}} = 1/N$ for any $\mathbf y, \mathbf z \in \mathcal S$ that differ in exactly one of the $N$ coordinates. Because of the symmetry, it's clear that we have a stationary distribution $\boldsymbol\phi = (\phi_{\mathbf y})$ where $\phi_{\mathbf y} = 1/|\mathcal S| = 1/2^N$ for all $\mathbf y \in \mathcal S$. Since the Markov chain is irreducible and positive recurrent, this is the only stationary distribution. Hence the stationary probability the first urn contains $i$ balls is
	\[ \sum_{\mathbf y \in \mathcal S(i)} \phi_{\mathbf y}  = \big|\mathcal S(i)\big|\, \frac{1}{2^N} = \binom{N}{i} \frac 1{2^N} , \]
where $\mathcal S(i)$ is the set of $\mathbf y \in \mathcal S$ consisting of $i$ $1$s and $N-i$ $2$s.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Is this an equilibrium distribution?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* No. The number of balls in the left-hand urn switches between odd and even each turn, so the chain is periodic with period 2, and does not have an equilibrium distribution.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)**
In the long run, for what proportion of time are all of the balls in the same urn?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* By the ergodic theorem, the long run proportion of time that all the balls are in the same urn is
\[ \pi_0 + \pi_N = \phi_{(1,1,\dots,1)} + \phi_{(2,2,\dots,2)} = \frac{1}{2^N} + \frac{1}{2^N} = \frac{1}{2^{N-1}} . \]
