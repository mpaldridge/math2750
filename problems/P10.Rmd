::::: {.myq}
**1.** Consider the Markov jump process on $\mathcal S = \{1,2,3,4\}$ with generator matrix
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & \frac12 & \frac12 & 0 \\
                               \frac14 & -\frac12 & 0 & \frac14 \\  
                               \frac16 & 0 & -\frac13 & \frac16 \\
                               0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \end{pmatrix} . \]

**(b)** Write down the communicating classes for this process, and state whether they are recurrent or transient.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
The class $\{1,2,3\}$ is not closed, so is transient. The class $\{4\}$ is closed, so positive recurrent.

**(c)** Calculate the hitting probability $h_{13}$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Conditioning on the first step, we have
\begin{align*}
h_{13} &= \tfrac12 h_{23} + \tfrac12 h_{33} = \tfrac12 h_{23} + \tfrac12 \\
h_{23} &= \tfrac12 h_{13} + \tfrac12 h_{43} = \tfrac12 h_{13} ,
\end{align*}
since $h_{33} = 1$ and $h_{43} = 0$.
Substituting the second equation into the first gives
$h_{13} = \tfrac14 h_{13} + \tfrac12$, and so $h_{13} = \frac23$.

**(d)** Calculate the expected hitting time $\eta_{14}$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Conditioning on the first step, we have
\begin{align*}
\eta_{14} &= 1 + \tfrac12 \eta_{24} + \tfrac12 \eta_{34} \\
\eta_{24} &= 2 + \tfrac12 \eta_{14} + \tfrac12 \eta_{44} = 1 + \tfrac12 \eta_{14} \\
\eta_{34} &= 3 + \tfrac12 \eta_{14} + \tfrac12 \eta_{44} = 1 + \tfrac12 \eta_{14} .
\end{align*}
Substituting the second and third equations into the first give $\eta_{14} = \frac72 + \frac12 \eta_{14}$, so $\eta_{14} = 7$.

**2.** Consider a Markov jump process $(X(t))$ on a triangle, with the vertices labelled 1, 2, 3 going clockwise. In a short time period $\tau$, we move one step clockwise with probability $\alpha\tau + o(\tau)$, one step anticlockwise with probability $\beta\tau + o(\tau)$, or stay where we are. 

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Write down a generator matrix for this Markov jump process, and draw a transition rate diagram.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} -(\alpha + \beta) & \alpha & \beta \\\beta & -(\alpha + \beta) & \alpha \\ \alpha & \beta & -(\alpha + \beta) \end{pmatrix} . \]   
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the probability, starting from state 1, that we hit state 3 before state 2?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Starting from 1, we next move to 3 with probability $\beta/(\alpha+\beta)$, and otherwise we next move to 2, so the answer is $\beta/(\alpha+\beta)$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** What is the expected time $\eta_{13}$ to hit state 3 starting from state 1.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Conditioning on the first step, we have
\begin{align*}
\eta_{13} &= \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta} + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{23} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{33} = \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta} + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{23} \\
\eta_{23} &= \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta} + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{33} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{13} = \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{13} ,
\end{align*}
since $\eta_{33} = 0$. Substituting the second equation into the first and solving, we get
\[ \eta_{13} = \frac{2\alpha+\beta}{\alpha^2 + \alpha\beta + \beta^2} .  \]
:::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** Write down the transition matrix $\mathsf R$ for the jump chain $(Y_n)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
\[ \mathsf R = \frac{1}{\alpha+\beta} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \alpha & \beta \\\beta & 0 & \alpha \\ \alpha & \beta & 0 \end{pmatrix} . \]
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(e)** What is the probability in the jump chain $(Y_n)$ that, starting from state 1, that we hit state 3 before state 2?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Hitting probabilities are always the same for a Markov jump process and its jump chain, so this is $\beta/(\alpha+\beta)$, as in part (b).
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(f)** What is the expected number of steps in the jump chain $(Y_n)$ to hit state 3 starting from state 1.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
We have similar equations to before, with
\begin{align*}
\eta_{13} &= 1 + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{23} \\
\eta_{23} &= 1 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \eta_{13} .
\end{align*}
We substitute the second into the first and solve to get
\[ \eta_{13} = \frac{2\alpha^2 + 3\alpha\beta + \beta^2}{\alpha^2 + \alpha\beta + \beta^2} = (\alpha + \beta) \frac{(2\alpha+\beta)}{\alpha^2 + \alpha\beta + \beta^2} .  \]
This is $(\alpha + \beta)$ times the original answer, reflecting the extra average time we spend in each state in the continuous time process.

**3.** 

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Calculate the stationary distribution for a Markov jump process with generator matrix
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -3 & 2 \\ 0 & 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix}.   \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
First, we write out the equations for $\boldsymbol\pi \mathsf Q = \mathbf 0$:
\begin{align*}
-2 \pi_1 + \phantom{3}\pi_2 \phantom{{}+2\pi_3} &= 0 \\
\pi_1 - 3\pi_2 + 2\pi_3 &= 0 \\
\pi_1 + 2\pi_2 - 2\pi_3 &= 0 .
\end{align*}
Second, we discard the second equation and choose $\pi_1$ as the working variable, to get
\begin{align*}
\pi_2 \phantom{{}+2\pi_3 }&= 2\pi_1 \\
-2\pi_2 + 2\pi_3 &= \pi_1 ,
\end{align*}
Substituting the second first into the second gives $\pi_3 = \frac{5}{2}\pi_1$.
Third, the normalising condition gives
\[ \pi_1 + 2\pi_1 + \tfrac52 \pi_1 = 1  , \]
meaning $\pi_1 = \frac{2}{11}$. We get the solution $\boldsymbol\pi = (\frac{2}{11}, \frac{4}{11}, \frac{5}{11})$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Fill in the missing entries of the following generator matrix, and find two stationary distributions for the associated Markov jump process:
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} ? & 2 & 0 \\ ? & -3 & 0 \\ ? & ? & 0 \end{pmatrix}.   \]

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Since rows add up to $0$, and since off-diagonal elements cannot be negative, we have
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.   \]

Since state $3$ is absorbing, we have that $(0,0,1)$ is a stationary distribution. For another, we seek a stationary distribution on states $1$ and $2$. The equations for $\boldsymbol\pi \mathsf Q = \mathbf 0$ are
\[ -2\pi_1 + 3 \pi_2 = 0 \qquad 2\pi_2 - 3 \pi_2 = 0 , \]
with solution $(\frac35, \frac25, 0)$.

::::: {.myq}
**4.** Consider a Markov jump process $(X(t))$ with state space $\mathcal S = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and generator matrix
\[ \mathsf Q = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & -4 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.   \]

**(a)** Draw a transition rate diagram for $(X(t))$.

::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Write down the communicating classes for $(X(t))$, and state if each one is positive recurrent, null recurrent, or transient. Are there any absorbing states?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
$\{1,2\}$ is positive recurrent, $\{3\}$ is transient, $\{4\}$ is positive recurrent and is an absorbing state.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** Calculate the hitting probability $h_{31}$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Conditioning on the first step, we have
\[ h_{31} = \tfrac14 h_{11} + \tfrac24 h_{21} + \tfrac14 h_{41} .   \]
Further, it's clear that $h_{11} = h_{21} = 1$ and $h_{41} = 0$, and thus we get $h_{31} = \frac34$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** Does $(X(t))$ have an equilibrium distribution?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
No, because the limiting distribution depends on the initial distribution. For example, starting in $4$, we have $\mathbb P(X_n = 4 \mid X_0 = 4) = 1$; but starting in $1$ we have $\mathbb P(X_n = 4 \mid X_0 = 1) = 0$.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** Conditional on Markov jump process starting from $X(0) = 3$, calculate the limiting probabilities $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb P(X(t) = j \mid X(0) = 3)$ for all $j \in \mathcal S$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
Starting from 3 we must leave 3 and not return. With probability $\frac14$ we enter the absorbing state 4, while with probability $\frac34$ we enter the closed class $\{1,2,\}$. To know what happens in the latter case, we seek a stationary distribution on $\{1,2\}$. The equations for $\boldsymbol\pi \mathsf Q = \mathbf 0$ are
\[ -2\pi_1 + \pi_2 = 0 \qquad 2\pi_2 - \pi_1 = 0 ,  \]
with solution $\boldsymbol\pi = (\frac13, \frac23, 0,0)$. Hence, the limiting probability starting from $X(0) = 3$ is
\[ \left( \tfrac34 \pi_1, \tfrac34 \pi_2, 0, \tfrac14 \right) = \left( \tfrac14, \tfrac12 , 0, \tfrac14 \right) . \]

:::: {.myq}
**5.** Suppose $(X(t))$ is a continuous time Markov jump process with a stationary distribution $\boldsymbol\phi = (\phi_i)$. Show that $\boldsymbol\pi = (\pi_i)$, where
\[ \pi_i = \frac{q_i \phi_i}{\sum_j q_j \phi_j} ,\]
is a stationary distribution for the discrete time jump chain associated to $\big(X(t)\big)$.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 
	The denominator $\sum_j q_j\phi_j$ is just a normalising constant. We must show that the vector $(q_i\phi_i)$ satisfies $\boldsymbol\pi\mathsf R = \boldsymbol\pi$. Written in coordinate form, this is
\begin{align*}
\sum_i (q_i\phi_i)r_{ij} &= \sum_{i \neq j}q_i\phi_i \frac{q_{ij}}{q_i} \tag{writing $r_{ij}$ in terms of $q_{ij}$} \\
&= \sum_{i \neq j} \phi_i q_{ij} \\
&= \sum_i \phi_iq_{ij} + q_j\phi_j \tag{since $q_j = -q_{jj}$} \\
&= 0 + q_j\phi_j \tag{since $\boldsymbol\phi\mathsf Q = \mathbf 0$} \\
&= q_j \phi_j ,
\end{align*}
as required.
