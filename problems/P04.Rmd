You should attempt all these questions and write up your solutions in advance of your workshop in week 5 (Monday 22 or Tuesday 23 February) where the answers will be discussed.

::::: {.myq}
**1.** Consider the Markov chain with state space $\mathcal S = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and transition matrix
\[ \mathsf P = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1-\alpha & 0 & \alpha & 0 \\
0 & \beta & 0 & 1-\beta \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}   \]
where $0 < \alpha, \beta < 1$.

**(a)** Draw a transition diagram for this Markov chain.

**(b)** What are the communicating classes for this Markov chain? Is the chain irreducible? Which classes are closed? Which states are absorbing?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 	Clearly $\{1\}$ and $\{4\}$ are closed communicating classes, so $1$ and $4$ are absorbing states. The other class, $\{2,3\}$ is not closed. Because there are multiple classes, the chain is not irreducible.

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** Find the hitting probability $h_{21}$ that, starting from state 2, the chain hits state 1.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* 	It's clear that $h_{11} = 1$ and $h_{41} = 0$. Then, by conditioning on the first step, we have
	\begin{gather*}
	h_{21} = \alpha h_{31} + (1-\alpha) h_{11} = \alpha h_{31} + 1 - \alpha \\
	h_{31} = \beta h_{21} + (1-\beta) h_{41} = \beta h_{21} .
	\end{gather*}
	Substituting the second equation into the first, we get $h_{21} = \alpha\beta h_{21} + 1 - \alpha$, so
	\[ h_{21} = \frac{1-\alpha}{1-\alpha\beta}  . \]

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** What is the expected time, starting from state 2, to reach an absorbing state?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Let's write $A = \{1,4\}$ for the absorbing states, and $\eta_{iA}$ for the time to reach an absorbing state starting from state $i$. Clearly $\eta_{1A} = \eta_{4A} = 0$. By conditioning on the first step, we have
	\begin{gather*}
	\eta_{2A} = 1 + \alpha \eta_{3A} + (1-\alpha) \eta_{1A} = 1 + \alpha \eta_{3A}  \\
	\eta_{3A} = 1 + \beta \eta_{2A} + (1-\beta) \eta_{4A} = 1+\beta \eta_{2A} .
	\end{gather*}
	Substituting the second equation into the first gives
	$\eta_{2A}= 1 + \alpha + \alpha\beta \eta_{2A}$, so
	\[ \eta_{2A} = \frac{1+\alpha}{1-\alpha\beta}  . \]

				0 & 0 & 0 & \frac14 & \frac34 \\

**(b)** Show that the chain is irreducible.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* We have paths $1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 1$ and $1 \to 3 \to 5 \to 1$, so every state communicates with state 1, so by transitivity every state communicates with every other state.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)** What are the periods of the states?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Any path from $1$ to $1$ goes $1 \to \{2 \text{ or }3\} \to \{4 \text{ or }5\} \to 1$. So $p_{11}^{(n)} > 0$ if and only if $n$ is a multiple of $3$. So state $1$ has period $d_1 = 3$. Because the chain is irreducible, all other states have period $3$ too.

::::

:::: {.subq}
**(d)** Find the expected hitting times $\eta_{i1}$ from each state $i$ to 1, and the expected return time $\mu_i$ to 1.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* We could do this through a traditional conditioning on the first step argument. But in fact, the cyclic structure $1 \to \{2 \text{ or }3\} \to \{4 \text{ or }5\} \to 1$ makes it immediately clear that $\eta_11 = 0$, $\eta_{41}=\eta_{51} = 1$, $\eta_{21} = \eta_{31} = 2$, and $\mu_1 = 3$.

**3.**

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** Show that every Markov chain on a finite state space $\mathcal S$ has at least one closed communicating class.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* For communicating classes $C,D$, let's write $C \to D$ if there is an $i \in C$ and $j \in D$ with $i \to j$. Note that we can't have both $C \to D$ and $D \to C$ is $C$ and $D$ are distinct classes. This is because there would be $i_1, j_2 \in C$ and $i_2, j_1 \in D$ such that $i_1 \to i_2 \to j_1 \to j_2 \to i_1$, so they would be the same class. Let's also note that there are a finite number of classes $m$.
		
Pick a class $C_1$. If $C_1$ is closed, we are done; otherwise $C_1 \to C_2$ for some other class $C_2$. If $C_2$ is closed, we are done; otherwise $C_2 \to C_3$ for some class $C_3$ different to $C_1$ and $C_2$. (It can't be $C_1$ by the arguemnt.) We repeat: if $C_k$ is closed, we are done; otherwise there's a new class $C_{k+1}$ with $C_k \to C_{k+1}$. Repeating, we eventually find a closed class: we either terminate before step $m$ at a closed class, or otherwise $C_m$ must be closed, as none of the previous $m-1$ classes can be accessible from it, by our earlier example.
:::
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** Give an example of a Markov chain that has no closed communicating classes.

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* By part (a), the state space must be infinite. Here's one example: take $\mathcal S = \mathbb Z$, and $X_{n+1} = X_n + 1$ with probability $1$. There are no states $i$ and $j$ such that $i \leftrightarrow j$ except for states communicating with themselves, so each state is a separate class. But clearly there is no absorbing state.

$\eta_{i0} = i/(q-p)$.

The Markov chain starts from state 1.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)** What is the probability that we hit state 2 before we hit state 3?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
*Solution.* Write $k_i$ for the probability we hit state $2$ before state $3$ starting from $i$. Then clearly $k_2 = 1$ (since we've hit $2$ first) and $k_3 = 0$ (since we've hit $3$ first). Further, by conditioning on the first step, $k_4 = \frac13 k_2 + \frac23 k_3 = \frac13$, and
\[ k_1 = \tfrac14 k_2 + \tfrac12k_3 + \tfrac14 k_4   = \tfrac14 + \tfrac14 k_4 = \tfrac14 + \tfrac14\tfrac13 = \tfrac13 . \]
The desired solution is $k_1 = \frac13$.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)** What is the expected time until we hit a state in the set $\{2,3\}$?

::: {.myanswers data-latex=""}
Let $A = \{2,3\}$, and $\eta_{iA}$ be the expected time until hitting the first of states $2$ and $3$ starting from $i$. Clearly $\eta_{2A} = \eta_{3A} = 0$. By conditioning on the first step, $\eta_{4A} = 1+ \frac13 \eta_{2A} + \frac23 \eta_{3A} = 1$, and
\[ \eta_{1A} = 1 + \tfrac14 \eta_{2A} + \tfrac12\eta_{3A} + \tfrac14 \eta_{4A} = 1 + \tfrac14 = \tfrac54 .        \]
The desired solution is $\eta_{1A} = \tfrac54$.
