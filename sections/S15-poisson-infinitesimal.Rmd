## Definition 3: increments in infinitesimal time  {#infinitesimal}


We have seen two definitions of the Poisson process so far: one in terms of increments having a Poisson distribution, and one in therms of holding times having an exponential distribution. Here we will see another definition, by looking at what happens in a very small time period of length $\tau$. Advantages of this approach include that does not require direct assumptions on the distributions involved, so may seem more "natural" or "inevitable" -- I consider this a conclusive argument that, if there are intelligent aliens out there, they have the Poisson process too! It also shows links between Markov processes and differential equations. A disadvantage is that it's normally easier to do calculations with the Poisson or exponential definitions.

Let $(X(t))$ be a stochastic processes counting some arrivals over time. Consider the number of arrivals in a very small time period $\tau$, which is $X(t+\tau) - X(t)$. The following (seemingly) weak assumptions seem justified:

* It's quite likely that there will be no arrivals in the very small time period.
* It's possible there will be one arrival, and that probability will be proportional to the time period $\tau$.
* It's extremely unlikely there will be two or more arrivals in such a short time period.

To write this down formally in maths, we will consider $\mathbb P(X(t+\tau) - X(t) = j)$ as the length of the time period $\tau$ tends to zero.

It will be helpful to use "little-$o$" notation. Here $o(\tau)$ means a term that is of "lower order" compared to $\tau$. Specifically, $o(\tau)$ stands for a function of $\tau$ that tends to $0$ as $\tau \to 0$ even when divided by $\tau$. That is,
\[ f(\tau) = o(\tau) \qquad \iff \qquad \frac{f(\tau)}{\tau} \to 0 \quad \text{as $\tau \to 0$.}  \]
Then our suggestions above translates to
\begin{equation} \mathbb P \big(X(t+\tau) - X(t) = j\big) = \begin{cases} 1 - \lambda \tau + o(\tau) & \text{if $j = 0$,} \\
\lambda\tau + o(\tau) & \text{if $j = 1$,} \\
o(\tau) & \text{if $j \geq 2$.} \end{cases} (\#eq:tau) \end{equation}
as $\tau \to 0$.

It will not be surprising to learn that we have once again defined the Poisson process with rate $\lambda$.

::: {.theorem #def-inf}
Let $(X(t))$ be a stochastic process with the following properties:

1. $X(0) = 0$;
2. infinitesimal increments: $X(t+\tau) - X(t)$ has the structure in \@ref(eq:tau) above, as $\tau \to 0$;
3. independent increments: $X(t_2) - X(t_1)$ and $X(t_4) - X(t_3)$ are independent for all $t_1 \leq t_2 \leq t_3 \leq t_4$.

Then $(X(t))$ is a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$.

We will prove this in a moment. First let's see an example of its use.


## Example: sum of two Poisson processes  {#sum2}

We [mentioned before the sum of two Poisson processes](#summed-marked): that if $(X(t))$ is a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and $(Y(t))$ is an independent Poisson process with rate $\mu$, then the sum $(Z(t))$ where $Z(t) = X(t) + Y(t)$ is a Poisson process with rate $\lambda + \mu$.

On [Problem Sheet 7](#P07), Question 3, you proved this from the Poisson increments definition. But it's perhaps easier using the infinitesimals.

We have
\begin{align*}\mathbb P\big( Z(t+\tau) - Z(t) = 0 \big) &= \mathbb P\big( X(t+\tau) - X(t) = 0 \big) \, \mathbb P\big( Y(t+\tau) - Y(t) = 0 \big) \\ &=\big(1 - \lambda \tau + o(\tau) \big)\big(1 - \mu \tau + o(\tau) \big) \\
&= 1 - (\lambda + \mu)\tau + o(\tau) , \end{align*}
since $Z$ does not increase provided neither $X$ nor $Y$ increase. We also have
\begin{align*}\mathbb P\big( Z(t+{}&\tau) - Z(t) = 1 \big) \\
&= \mathbb P\big( X(t+\tau) - X(t) = 1 \big) \, \mathbb P\big( Y(t+\tau) - Y(t) = 0 \big) \\ &\qquad {}+ \mathbb P\big( X(t+\tau) - X(t) = 0 \big) \, \mathbb P\big( Y(t+\tau) - Y(t) = 1 \big) \\
&= \big(\lambda \tau + o(\tau) \big)\big(1 - \mu \tau + o(\tau) \big) + \big(1 - \lambda \tau + o(\tau) \big)\big(\mu \tau + o(\tau) \big) \\
&= (\lambda + \mu)\tau + o(\tau) , \end{align*}
since $Z$ increases by 1 if either $X$ increases by 1 and $Y$ stays fixed or vice versa. We used here that the probability that both $X$ and $Y$ increase is of order $\tau^2 = o(\tau)$. Finally, since probabilities must add up to 1, we must have
\[ \mathbb P\big( Z(t+\tau) - Z(t) \geq 2 \big) =  o(\tau) . \]

But what we have written down is precisely the infinitesimals definition of a Poisson process with rate $\lambda + \mu$.



## Forward equations and proof of equivalence  {#forward}


If we compare Theorem \@ref(thm:def-inf) to the [definition of the Poisson process in terms of Poisson increments](#thm:#poisson-def-1), we see that properties 1 and 3 are the same. We only need to check property 2, that $X(t+s) - X(s)$ is a Poisson distribution with rate $\lambda t$.

Since the increments as defined in \@ref(eq:tau) are time homogeneous, it will suffice to consider $s = 0$. So we need to show that $X(t) \sim \text{Po}(\lambda t)$. 

Write $p_j(t) = \mathbb P(X(t) = j)$. Then for $j \geq 1$ we have
 \[ p_j(t + \tau) = \big(1 - \lambda\tau + o(\tau)\big)p_j(t) + \big(\lambda\tau + o(\tau)\big) p_{j-1}(t) + o(\tau) , \]
since we get to $j$ either by staying at $j$ or moving up from $j-1$, with all other highly unlikely possibilities being absorbed into the $o(\tau)$. In order to deal with increments, it will be convenient to take a $p_{j}(t)$ to the left-hand side and rearrange, to get the increment
\[ p_j(t + \tau) - p_j(t) = -\lambda\tau p_j(t) + \lambda\tau p_{j-1}(\tau) + o(\tau) , \]
where "constant times $o(\tau)$" is itself $o(\tau)$.

The only way to deal with the $o(\tau)$ term, given its definition, is to divide everything by $\tau$ and send $\tau \to 0$. Dividing by $\tau$ gives
\[ \frac{p_j(t + \tau) - p_j(t)}{\tau} = -\lambda p_j(t) + \lambda p_{j-1}(t) + \frac{o(\tau)}{\tau} . \]
Sending $\tau$ to 0, the term $o(\tau)/\tau$ tends to 0 and vanishes, while we recognise the limit of the left-hand side as being the derivative $\mathrm d p_j(t) / \mathrm d t = p'_j(t)$.
This leaves us with the differential equation
\[ p'_j(t) = -\lambda p_j(t) + \lambda p_{j-1}(t) . \]
We also have the initial condition $p_j(0) = 0$ for $j \geq 1$, since we start at 0, not at any $j \geq 1$.

We have to deal with the case $j = 0$ separately. This is similar but a bit easier. We have
\[ p_0(t + \tau) = \big(1 - \lambda\tau + o(\tau)\big)p_0(t) , \]
since we must previously been at 0, then seen no arrivals.
After rearranging to get an increment and sending $\tau \to 0$, as before, we get the differential equation
\[ p'_0(t) = -\lambda p_0(t) \]
with the initial condition $p_0(0) = 1$, since we always start at 0.

In summary, we have derived the following equations:
\begin{align*}
   p'_0(t) &= -\lambda p_0(t) & \hspace{-1.5cm} p_0(0) & = 1 ,\\
   p'_j(t) &= -\lambda p_j(t) + \lambda p_{j-1}(t) & \hspace{-1.5cm} p_j(0) &= 0 \quad \text{for $j \geq 1$} .
\end{align*}
These are called the **Kolmogorov forward equations**.

We claim that the solution to these equations is the Poisson distribution
\[ p_j(t) = \ee^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^j}{j!} . \]
This would prove the theorem.

We must check that the claim holds. For $j = 0$, the Poisson probability is 
\[ p_0(t) = \ee^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^0}{0!} = \ee^{-\lambda t} . \]
This has 
\[ p'_0(t) = -\lambda \ee^{-\lambda t} = -\lambda p_0(t) , \]
as desired, and we also have the correct initial condition $p_0(0) = \ee^{0} = 1$.

For $j \geq 1$, the left-hand side is
\begin{align*}
p'_j(t) &= \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d t} \ee^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^j}{j!} \\
& = \frac{1}{j!} \left(-\lambda \ee^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^j + \ee^{-\lambda t} \lambda j(\lambda t)^{j-1} \right) \\
&= - \lambda \ee^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^j}{j!} + \lambda \ee^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^{j-1}}{(j-1)!} \\
&= -\lambda p_j(t) + \lambda p_{j-1}(t)
\end{align*}
as desired. We also have the initial condition $p_j(0) = \ee^{0} 0^j/j! = 0$.
The claim is proven, and we are (finally) done.
