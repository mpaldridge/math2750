## Communicating classes  {#comm-classes}

If we have a large complicated Markov chain, it can be useful to split the state space up into smaller pieces that can be studied separately. The idea is to split to states $i$ and $j$ into different pieces if we can't move from $i$ to $j$ and then back again after some number of steps.

::: {.definition #comm}
Consider a Markov chain on a state space $\mathcal S$ with transition matrix $\mathsf P$. We say that state $j\in\mathcal{S}$ is **accessible** from state $i\in\mathcal{S}$ and write $i \to j$ if, for some $n$, $p_{ij}(n)>0$.
	
If $i \to j$ and $j \to i$, we say that $i$ **communicates with** $j$ and write $i \leftrightarrow j$.
:::

Here, the condition $p_{ij}(n)>0$ means that, starting from $i$, there's a positive chance that we'll get to $j$ at some point in the future -- hence the term "accessible".

::: {.theorem #equiv-rel}
Consider a Markov chain on a state space $\mathcal S$ with transition matrix $\mathsf P$. Then the "communicates with" relation $\leftrightarrow$ is an [**equivalence relation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation); that is, it has the following properties:

* **reflexive**: $i \leftrightarrow i$ for all $i$;
* **symmetric**: if $i \leftrightarrow j$ then $j \leftrightarrow i$;
* **transitive**: if $i \leftrightarrow j$ and $j \leftrightarrow k$ then $i \leftrightarrow k$.
:::

::: {.proof}
*Reflexivity*: Clearly $p_{ii}(0) = 1 > 0$, because in "zero steps" we stay where we are. So $i \leftrightarrow i$ for all $i$.
	
*Symmetry*: The definition of $i \leftrightarrow j$ is symmetric under swapping $i$ and $j$.
	
*Transitivity*. If we can get from $i$ to $j$ and we can get from $j$ to $k$, then we can get from $i$ to $k$ by going via $j$. We just need to write that out formally.

Since $i \to j$, we have $p_{ij}(n) > 0$ for some $n$, and since $j \to k$, we also have $p_{jk}(m) > 0$ for some $m$. Then, by the Chapman--Kolmogorov equations, we have
\[ p_{ik}(n+m) = \sum_{l \in \mathcal S} p_{il}(n) p_{lk}(m) \geq p_{ij}(n) p_{jk}(m) > 0 , \]
from just picking out the $l=j$ term in the sum. So $i \to k$ too.

The same argument with $k$ and $i$ swapped gives $k \to i$ also, so $i \leftrightarrow k$.
:::

A fact you may remember about equivalence relations is that an equivalence relation, like $\leftrightarrow$, partitions the space $\mathcal S$ into [**equivalence classes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class). This means that each state $i$ is in exactly one equivalence class, and that class is the set of states $j$ such that $i \leftrightarrow j$. In this context, we call these **communicating classes**.

::: {.example #rw-class}
In the simple random walk, provided $p$ is not $0$ or $1$, every state communicates with every other state, because from $i$ when can get to $j > i$ by going up $j - i$ times, and we can get to $j < i$ by going down $i - j$ times.. Therefore the whole state space $\mathcal S = \mathbb Z$ is one communicating class.
:::

::: {.example #gamblers-class}
Consider the gambler's ruin Markov chain on $\{0,1,\dots,m\}$. There are three communicating classes: $\{0\}$ and $\{m\}$, which don't communicate with any other states, and $\{1,2,\dots,m-1\}$, which is like the simple random walk.
:::

::: {.example #hsd-class}
Consider the following simple model for an epidemic. We have three states: healthy (H), sick (S), and dead (D). This transition matrix is
\[ \mathsf P = \begin{pmatrix} p_{\mathrm{HH}} & p_{\mathrm{HS}} & 0 \\
p_{\mathrm{SH}} & p_{\mathrm{SS}} & p_{\mathrm{SD}} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} ,    \]
and the transition diagram is:

```{tikz HSD, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=4}
\usetikzlibrary{automata}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
	\node[state] (H) at (0,0) {H};
	\node[state] (S) at (3,0) {S};
	\node[state] (D) at (6,0) {D};
	
	\path[->]   (H) edge[bend left] node {} (S);
	\path[->]	(S) edge[bend left] node {} (H);
	\path[->]   (H) edge[loop left] node {} ();
	\path[->]   (S) edge[loop above] node {} ();
	\path[->]   (D) edge[loop right] node {} ();
	\path[->]	(S) edge node {} (D);
	
	%\draw[dashed]	(-1,1)--(5,1);
	%\draw[dashed]	(5,1)--(5,-1);
	%\draw[dashed]	(5,-1)--(-1,-1);
	%\draw[dashed]	(-1,-1)--(-1,1);
	
	%\draw[dashed]	(-1,-1)--(-1,-3);
	%\draw[dashed]	(-1,-3)--(5,-3);
	%\draw[dashed]	(5,-3)--(5,-1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
```

Clearly H and S communicate with each other (you can become infected or recover), while D only communicates with itself (the dead do not recover). Hence, the state space $\mathcal S = \{\mathrm{H},\mathrm{S},\mathrm{D}\}$ partitions into two communicating classes: $\{\mathrm{H},\mathrm{S}\}$ and $\{\mathrm{D}\}$.
:::


A few more definitions that will be important later.

::: {.definition #irreducible}
If the entire state space $\mathcal S$ is one communicating class, we say that the Markov chain is **irreducible**.

We say that a communicating class is **closed** if no state outside the class is accessible from any state within the class. That is, class $C \subset \mathcal S$ is closed if whenever there exist $i \in C$ and $j \in \mathcal S$ with $i \to j$, then $j \in C$ also. If a class is not closed, we say it is **open**.

If a state $i$ is in a communicating class $\{i\}$ by itself and that class is closed, then we say state $i$ is **absorbing**.
:::

::: {.example #ex-irred}
Going back to the previous examples:

* In the simple random walk, the whole state space is one communicating class which must therefore be closed. The Markov chain has only one class, so is irreducible.
* In the gambler's ruin, classes $\{0\}$ and $\{m\}$ are closed, because the Markov chain stays there forever, and because these closed classes consist of only one state each, $0$ and $m$ are absorbing states. The class $\{1, 2, \dots, m-1\}$ is open, as we can escape the class by going to $0$ or $m$. The gambler's ruin chain has multiple classes, so is not irreducible.
* In the "healthy--sick--dead" chain, the class $\{D\}$ is closed, so D is an absorbing state, while the class $\{H, S\}$ is open, as one can leave it by dying. The Markov chain is not irreducible.

## Periodicity  {#periodicity}


When [we discussed the simple random walk, we noted](#S02-exact-distribution) that it alternates between even-numbered and odd-numbered states. This "periodic" behaviour is important to understand if we want to know what will happen to the Markov chain in the future.

The idea is this: List the number of steps for all possible paths starting and ending in the state.  Then the period is the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) (or "highest common factor") of the integers in this list. 

::: {.definition #period}
Consider a Markov chain with transition matrix $\mathsf P$. We say that a state $i\in\mathcal{S}$ has **period** $d_i$, where
\[ d_i=\text{gcd}\big\{n\in\{1,2,\dots,\} : p_{ii}(n) > 0\big\} , \]
where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.
  
If $d_i>1$, then the state $i$ is called **periodic**; if $d_i = 1$, then $i$ is called **aperiodic**.  
:::

::: {.example #rw-period}
Consider the simple random walk with $p \neq 0,1$. We have $p_{ii}(n) = 0$ for odd $n$, since we swap from odd to even each step. But $p_{ii}(2) = 2pq > 0$. Therefore, all states are periodic with period $\text{gcd}\{2,4,6,\dots\} = 2$.
:::

::: {.example #gamblers-period}
For the gambler's ruin, states $0$ and $m$ are aperiodic (have period $1$), since they are absorbing states. The remaining states states $1,2,\dots,m-1$ are periodic with period $2$, because we swap between odd and even states, as in the simple random walk.
:::

::: {.example #weird-period}
Consider the Markov chain with transition diagram as shown:

```{tikz periods, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=5}
\usetikzlibrary{automata}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
		\node[state] (1) at (0,0) {$2$};
		\node[state] (2) at (1.41,1.41) {$1$};
		\node[state] (3) at (1.41,-1.41) {$3$};
		\node[state] (4) at (2.83,0) {$4$};
		\node[state] (5) at (4.83,0) {$5$};
		\node[state] (6) at (6.56,1) {$6$};
		\node[state] (7) at (6.56,-1) {$7$};
		
		\path[->] (1) edge[bend left] node [above left]{$\frac12$} (2);
		\path[->] (2) edge[bend left] node [above right]{$\frac12$} (4);
		\path[->] (4) edge[bend left] node [below right]{$\frac13$} (3);
        \path[->] (3) edge[bend left] node [below left]{$\frac12$} (1);
		\path[->] (1) edge[bend left] node [below left]{$\frac12$} (3);
		\path[->] (3) edge[bend left] node [below right]{$\frac12$} (4);
		\path[->] (4) edge[bend left] node [above right]{$\frac13$} (2);
        \path[->] (2) edge[bend left] node [above left]{$\frac12$} (1);
        
        \path[->] (4) edge node [above]{$\frac13$} (5);
        \path[->] (5) edge node [above left]{$1$} (6);
        \path[->] (6) edge node [right]{$1$} (7);
        \path[->] (7) edge node [below left]{$1$} (5);
		\end{tikzpicture}
```

Importantly, we can't return from the triangle side back to the circle side. We thus see there are two communicating classes: $\{1,2,3,4\}$, which is open, and $\{5,6,7\}$, which is closed. The Markov chain is not irreducible, and there are no absorbing states.

The circle side swaps between odd and even states (until exiting from $4$ to $5$), so states $1$,$2$, $3$ and $4$ all have period $2$. The triangle side cycles around with certainty, meaning that states $5$, $6$, and $7$ all have period $3$.
:::

You may have noticed in these examples that, within a communicating class, every state has the same period. In fact, it's always the case that states in the same class have the same period.
   
::: {.theorem #class-period}
All states in a communicating class have the same period.

Formally: Consider a Markov chain on a state space $\mathcal S$ with transition matrix $\mathsf P$. If $i,j\in\mathcal S$ are such that $i \leftrightarrow j$, then $d_i = d_j$.
:::

In particular, in an irreducible Markov chain, all states have the same period $d$. We say that an irreducible Markov chain is **periodic** if $d>1$ and **aperiodic** if $d=1$.

::: {.proof}
Let $i,j$ be such that $i \leftrightarrow j$. We want to show that $d_i = d_j$. First we'll show that $d_i \leq d_j$, and then we'll show that $d_j \leq d_i$, and thus conclude that they're equal.

Since $i\leftrightarrow j$, there exist $n,m$ such that $p_{ij}(n)>0$ and $p_{ji}(m)>0$. Then, by the Chapman--Kolmogorov equations,
\[ p_{ii}(n+m) =  \sum_{k \in \mathcal S} p_{ik}(n) p_{ki}(m) \geq p_{ij}(n) p_{ji}(m) > 0 .  \]
So $d_i$ divides $n+m$.

Let $r$ be such that $p_{jj}(r)>0$.  Then, by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations again,
	\[
	p_{ii}(n+m+r)\geq  p_{ij}(n) p_{jj}(r) p_{ji}(m) > 0.
	\]
	Hence $d_i$ divides $n+m+r$. But since $d_i$ divides $n+m$, it must be that $d_i$ divides $r$ also. So whenever $p_{jj}(r)>0$, we have that $d_i$ divides $r$. Since $d_i$ is a common divisor of all the $r$s with $p_{jj}(r)>0$, it can't be any bigger that the *greatest* common divisor of all those $r$s. But that greatest common divisor is by definition $d_j$, the period of $j$. So $d_i \leq d_j$.
	
Repeating the same argument but with $i$ and $j$ swapped over, we get $d_j\leq d_i$ too, and we're done.
